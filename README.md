# Web_Development
Various Web Development stuff

This is a repository of my personal projects for Web Development. Currently there is no back-end stuff yet. I am learning the Django Framework to start off in the world of back-end technologies. I have recently learned Python and wanted to challenge myself with my new skill. Django seemed like a perfect way for me to start learning web development and incorporate a new language.

Quick Summary of Projects
1. Two_Spectrum: Simple HTML and CSS site created with tables
2. Startup_FrontEnd: More in depth Front End that asks for a form submission to a thank you page with CSS styling.
3. Coffee Lovers: Front End Only that uses Bootstrap as it's design Framework

Summary of what I am working on now
1. Finishing up understanding of Bootstrap Framework
2. Dive more in depth into JavaScript

Future Goals
1. Dive into jQuery
2. Learn Django Framework
