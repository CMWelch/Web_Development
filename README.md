# Web_Development
Various Web Development stuff

This is a repository of my personal projects for Web Development. Currently there is no backend stuff yet. I am learning the Django Framework to start off in the world of backend technologies. I have recently learned Python and wanted to challenge myself with my new skill. Django seemed like a perfect way for me to start learning web development and incorporate a new language.

Summary of what I am working on now
1. Finishing up understanding of Bootstrap Framework
2. Dive more in depth into JavaScript

Future Goals
1. Dive into jQuery
2. Learn Django Framework

Below are some examples of Projects I have worked on so far. You can also view more images under the Images folder in this repository.
